## Alzheimer's Disease Prediction

This project focuses on the classification of Alzheimer’s disease stages using structural MRI brain images and deep learning. I trained and evaluated convolutional neural network models, including a pre-trained EfficientNetV2B0, to classify MRI scans into four cognitive states: No Impairment, Very Mild Impairment, Mild Impairment, and Moderate Impairment.

The model was trained on MRI data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and achieved 94% accuracy on unseen test data, demonstrating strong generalization. This work highlights the potential of deep learning and medical imaging for early-stage Alzheimer’s disease assessment.
